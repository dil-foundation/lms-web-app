-- COMPLETE CLASSES TABLE POLICY RESET AND FIX
-- =====================================================
-- This script completely resets all policies on classes table to fix conflicts
-- 
-- ISSUE FIXED: Policy conflicts causing 403 Forbidden on INSERT operations
-- 
-- ADMIN POLICY: Works correctly - admins can create, update, delete classes
-- TEACHER POLICY: Fixed to match admin pattern for consistency
-- 
-- Users with 'teacher' role in profiles table can:
-- 1. View all classes (needed for class creation and management)
-- 2. Create any classes (full permission to create new classes)
-- 3. Update classes they teach
-- 4. Delete classes they teach
-- 5. Update classes they created (via created_by field)
-- 6. Delete classes they created (via created_by field)
-- 7. Manage any class assignments (add/remove teachers from any class)
-- 8. Manage students in any class (add/remove students from any class)
-- =====================================================

-- 6. VERIFICATION QUERIES (Optional - for testing)
-- =====================================================

-- Verify all policies were created successfully
SELECT

    permissive,
    roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('classes', 'class_teachers', 'class_students')

-- Test the INSERT policy for classes table
-- This should show the exact policy condition

    policyname,
    with_check as policy_condition
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'classes'

    AND policyname = 'Teachers can create classes';

-- Uncomment these queries to test the policies:

-- Test 1: Check if teachers can see classes they teach
-- SELECT * FROM public.classes WHERE id IN (
--   SELECT class_id FROM class_teachers WHERE teacher_id = auth.uid()
-- );

-- Test 2: Check if teachers can see their class assignments
-- SELECT * FROM public.class_teachers WHERE teacher_id = auth.uid();

-- Test 3: Check if teachers can see students in their classes
-- SELECT * FROM public.class_students WHERE class_id IN (

-- );

-- =====================================================
-- 7. CREATE TEST FUNCTION FOR DEBUGGING
-- =====================================================

-- Create a function to test teacher policy logic
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_teacher_policy(user_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Test if user has teacher role
  RETURN EXISTS (
