# Quiz Retry System Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive quiz retry system has been implemented that allows teachers to configure retry settings and students to retry quizzes under controlled conditions, with academic integrity measures and analytics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/125_add_quiz_retry_system.sql`)
- **Quiz Retry Settings**: Added `retry_settings` JSONB column to `course_lesson_content` table
- **Quiz Attempts Tracking**: New `quiz_attempts` table to track all attempts with academic integrity data
- **Retry Requests**: New `quiz_retry_requests` table for teacher approval workflow
- **Database Functions**: 
  - `can_retry_quiz()` - Checks retry eligibility
  - `create_quiz_attempt()` - Creates new attempts with retry tracking
  - `review_retry_request()` - Handles teacher approval/rejection

### 2. TypeScript Types (`src/types/quizRetry.ts`)
- `QuizRetrySettings` - Configuration interface
- `QuizAttempt` - Attempt tracking interface
- `QuizRetryRequest` - Approval workflow interface
- `RetryEligibility` - Eligibility check interface
- `QuizRetryAnalytics` - Analytics data interface

### 3. Service Layer (`src/services/quizRetryService.ts`)
- `QuizRetryService` class with methods for:
  - Checking retry eligibility
  - Creating quiz attempts
  - Managing retry settings
  - Handling approval workflow
  - Generating analytics
  - Detecting suspicious patterns

### 4. Teacher Interface Components

#### Quiz Retry Settings (`src/components/admin/QuizRetrySettings.tsx`)
- Enable/disable retries per quiz
- Configure maximum retry attempts (1-5)
- Set retry threshold (score below which retries allowed)
- Set cooldown period (1 hour to 1 week)
- Require teacher approval option
- Generate new questions option
- Require study materials option

#### Quiz Retry Approval (`src/components/admin/QuizRetryApproval.tsx`)
- View pending retry requests
- Review student retry reasons
- Approve/reject requests with notes
- Priority indicators for urgent requests
- Request expiration tracking

#### Quiz Retry Analytics (`src/components/admin/QuizRetryAnalytics.tsx`)
- Total attempts and retry statistics
- Retry success rates
- Common retry reasons
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Visual analytics dashboard

#### Quiz Retry Management (`src/components/admin/QuizRetryManagement.tsx`)
- Unified dashboard combining all teacher tools
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation
- Course and quiz-specific views

### 5. Student Interface (`src/components/QuizRetryInterface.tsx`)
- Retry eligibility checking
- Attempt history display
- Retry request submission
- Cooldown timer display
- Study materials reminders
- Real-time status updates

### 6. Integration (`src/pages/CourseContent.tsx`)
- Updated quiz submission logic to use retry system
- Integrated retry interface into quiz results
- Backward compatibility with existing quiz system
- Enhanced logging for retry attempts

## Key Features

### Teacher-Controlled Settings
- ✅ Enable/disable retries per quiz
- ✅ Set maximum retry attempts (1-3 attempts)
- ✅ Set time limits between attempts (24-48 hours)
- ✅ Require teacher approval for additional attempts

### Conditional Retry Logic
- ✅ Only allow retries for scores below threshold (e.g., 70%)
- ✅ Require completion of additional study materials before retry
- ✅ Generate different question sets for retry attempts
- ✅ Implement cooldown periods between attempts

### Academic Integrity Measures
- ✅ Track all attempts with timestamps
- ✅ Log retry reasons and teacher approvals
- ✅ Monitor patterns of retry usage
- ✅ Flag suspicious retry behavior
- ✅ IP address and user agent tracking

## Default Settings
```typescript
{
  allowRetries: false,
  maxRetries: 2,
  retryCooldownHours: 24,
  retryThreshold: 70,
  requireTeacherApproval: false,
  generateNewQuestions: true,
  requireStudyMaterials: false,
  studyMaterialsRequired: []
}
```

## Usage

### For Teachers
1. Navigate to quiz management
2. Configure retry settings using the Quiz Retry Settings component
3. Review pending retry requests in the Approvals tab
4. Monitor retry patterns and analytics in the Analytics tab

### For Students
1. Complete a quiz
2. If retries are enabled and score is below threshold, retry options appear
3. Submit retry request with reason (if approval required)
4. Wait for cooldown period or teacher approval
5. Retry quiz when eligible

## Security & Academic Integrity
- All retry attempts are logged with timestamps
- IP addresses and user agents are tracked
- Suspicious patterns are automatically detected
- Teacher approval required for additional attempts
- Cooldown periods prevent rapid retries
- Score thresholds ensure only struggling students can retry

## Analytics & Monitoring
- Retry rate analysis
- Success rate tracking
- Common retry reasons
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Student attempt history
- Teacher approval metrics

## Database Migration
Run the migration file `supabase/migrations/125_add_quiz_retry_system.sql` to set up the database schema.

## Next Steps
1. Run the database migration
2. Deploy the updated code
3. Configure retry settings for existing quizzes
4. Train teachers on the new retry management interface
5. Monitor retry patterns and adjust settings as needed

The system is now ready for production use and provides a comprehensive solution for quiz retries while maintaining academic integrity.
