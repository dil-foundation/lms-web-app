3. **Assessment Mode:** Practice speaking/writing tasks with scoring and feedback
4. **Exploratory Mode:** Open-ended conversation for fluency practice

**Personalization:**

### **5.2 Safe Usage Guidelines**

**Do's:**
- ✅ Use for clarification of course content
- ✅ Request additional practice materials
- ✅ Get alternative explanations of difficult concepts
- ✅ Practice conversational language skills (speaking fluency)
- ✅ Ask for feedback on self-assessment answers

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ **Do NOT submit graded assignment work for AI to complete** (academic integrity violation)
- ❌ **Do NOT share personal sensitive information** (address, financial data, health info)
- ❌ **Do NOT use for non-educational purposes** (e.g., chat about unrelated topics)
- ❌ **Do NOT expect AI to replace teacher** (for complex feedback, consult teacher)

**Content Filters:**
- AI will refuse to answer questions about:
  - Completing graded assignments verbatim
  - Generating full essays for submission (will guide structure instead)
  - Off-topic discussions (politics, religion, adult content)
  - Requests that violate platform policies

**Accuracy Disclaimer:**
AI-generated content is generally reliable but may occasionally contain errors. Cross-check critical information with course materials or teacher.

### **5.3 Voice vs Text Interaction**

**Text Chat:**
- **Pros:** Precise, easy to copy/paste examples, permanent record
- **Cons:** Slower for conversational fluency practice

**Voice Chat:**
- **Pros:** Natural speaking practice, pronunciation feedback, hands-free
- **Cons:** Requires microphone, less accurate transcription in noisy environments

**Switching Modes:**
- Click microphone icon to toggle voice input
- Click keyboard icon to return to text
- Hybrid: Speak query, AI responds with text + audio playback

**Voice Settings:**
- **Speech Rate:** Slow, Normal, Fast (adjustable in AI Tutor settings)
