# Fix: Downloaded Courses Not Showing When Offline

## Issue Description
Downloaded courses were showing as "0" in the offline learning tab when the user was offline, even though courses were successfully downloaded when online. The courses would only appear after going online and then offline again.

## Root Cause
The `fetchEnrolledCourses` function in `OfflineLearning.tsx` was completely skipping the loading of downloaded courses when offline. It would:

1. Check if offline â†’ Skip everything and set empty state
2. Only load downloaded courses when online
3. This meant offline users saw "0 downloaded courses" even when they had courses stored locally

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Restructured Loading Logic**
- **Before**: Skip all loading when offline
- **After**: Always load downloaded courses and storage info first, regardless of online status

### 2. **Updated Function Flow**
```typescript
const fetchEnrolledCourses = useCallback(async () => {
  // âœ… ALWAYS load offline content first
  await loadDownloadedCourses();
  await loadStorageInfo();
  
  // Only fetch online courses if connected
  if (!navigator.onLine) {
    // Show offline content only
    return;
  }
  
  // Fetch online courses when available
  // ... online logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

### 3. **Enhanced Function Dependencies**
- Moved `loadDownloadedCourses`, `loadStorageInfo`, and `formatBytes` to proper `useCallback` hooks
- Fixed dependency arrays to prevent infinite re-renders
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. **Improved User Experience**
- Downloaded courses now show immediately when offline
- Storage usage displays correctly when offline
- Better console logging for troubleshooting

## Key Changes Made

### File: `src/components/student/OfflineLearning.tsx`

1. **Moved utility functions up** and wrapped in `useCallback`:
   - `formatBytes` - Now properly memoized
   - `loadDownloadedCourses` - Enhanced with better logging
   - `loadStorageInfo` - Enhanced with better logging

2. **Fixed `fetchEnrolledCourses` logic**:
   - Always loads offline content first
   - Only skips online fetching when offline (not all loading)
   - Proper dependency management

3. **Enhanced logging**:
   - `ðŸ“± OfflineLearning: Loaded X downloaded courses`
   - `ðŸ’¾ OfflineLearning: Storage used: X MB`
   - Clear online/offline status messages

## Testing Steps

### Test Case 1: Fresh Offline Load
1. Download a course while online
2. Close browser completely
3. Open browser in offline mode (DevTools Network â†’ Offline)
4. Navigate to `/dashboard/offline-learning`
5. **Expected**: Downloaded courses show immediately (not "0")

### Test Case 2: Online to Offline Transition
1. Start online with downloaded courses visible
2. Go offline using DevTools
3. **Expected**: Downloaded courses remain visible, online courses disappear

### Test Case 3: Offline to Online Transition  
1. Start offline with downloaded courses visible
2. Go online using DevTools
3. **Expected**: Downloaded courses remain + online courses load

## Success Criteria
- âœ… Downloaded courses display immediately when offline
- âœ… Storage usage shows correct values when offline
- âœ… No "0 downloaded courses" when courses exist
- âœ… Smooth online/offline transitions
- âœ… No console errors or infinite re-renders

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken Flow)
```
User goes offline â†’ fetchEnrolledCourses() â†’ 
Check offline â†’ Skip everything â†’ 
Set empty state â†’ Show "0 courses"
```

### After (Fixed Flow)
```
User goes offline â†’ fetchEnrolledCourses() â†’ 
Load offline courses â†’ Load storage info â†’ 
Check offline â†’ Skip online fetch only â†’ 
Show downloaded courses
```

### Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Faster offline loading (no failed network requests)
- **Neutral**: Same number of database operations
- **Improved**: Better caching with useCallback hooks

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, revert changes to:
- `src/components/student/OfflineLearning.tsx` (lines 73-212)

The fix maintains backward compatibility and only improves the offline experience.
