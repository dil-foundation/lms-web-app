# OpenAI Setup Guide for APEX AI Assistant

## 🚀 Enhanced APEX AI Assistant with OpenAI Integration

The APEX AI Assistant now uses OpenAI to intelligently generate database queries and responses based on user questions. This provides much more accurate and contextual answers.

## 🔑 Setting Up OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Add to Supabase Environment
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Edge Functions**
3. Add environment variable:
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (sk-...)

### Step 3: Deploy the Edge Function
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy apex-ai-assistant
```

## 🧠 How It Works Now

### 1. **Intelligent Query Generation**
When a user asks a question, OpenAI analyzes it and generates appropriate database queries:

**User asks**: "How do I reset my password?"
**OpenAI generates**:
```json
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "table": "apex_faqs",
      "searchFields": ["question", "answer"],
      "searchTerms": ["password", "reset", "forgot"],
      "purpose": "Find FAQ about password reset"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Smart Response Generation**
OpenAI then uses the query results to generate contextual responses:

**Query Results**: FAQ about password reset
**OpenAI Response**: "To reset your password, click 'Forgot Password' on the login page..."

### 3. **Fallback System**
- **Primary**: OpenAI + Database queries
- **Secondary**: Pattern matching + Database queries  
- **Tertiary**: Hardcoded responses

## 📊 What You'll See in Console Logs

```
🧠 Using OpenAI to generate intelligent database queries...
🔍 OpenAI Query Generation Response: {"queries":[...]}
📋 Generated Query Plan: {...}
🔎 Executing intelligent query on apex_faqs
✅ Intelligent query successful for apex_faqs, found 2 results
🤖 OpenAI generated response: To reset your password...
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Contextual Understanding**: OpenAI understands the intent behind questions
2. **Dynamic Queries**: Generates appropriate database queries for each question
3. **Natural Responses**: Creates human-like, helpful responses
4. **Continuous Learning**: Improves with conversation history
5. **Fallback Safety**: Always provides a response even if OpenAI fails

## 🔧 Testing

1. Ask: "Can the platform work on mobile devices?"
2. Check console logs to see OpenAI query generation
3. Verify the response is contextual and helpful

## 💡 Example Queries OpenAI Can Generate

- **Mobile questions** → Search FAQs for "mobile", "device", "app"
- **Password issues** → Search FAQs for "password", "reset", "login"
- **Support requests** → Query contact_info table for relevant departments
- **Course questions** → Search both FAQs and knowledge_base for course-related content

The system is now much more intelligent and will provide better, more relevant responses to user questions!
