# Course Deletion Trigger Conflict Fix

## Problem Description

The error `"tuple to be deleted was already modified by an operation triggered by the current command"` occurs when trying to delete a course. This is a PostgreSQL trigger conflict that happens when a `BEFORE DELETE` trigger tries to update the `updated_at` column of the row being deleted.

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by a trigger on the `courses` table that attempts to update the `updated_at` timestamp during DELETE operations. When PostgreSQL tries to delete a row, but a trigger modifies that same row first, it creates a conflict because the row has already been modified by the current command.

## Solution

### 1. Database Fix (Script: `051_fix_course_delete_trigger_conflict.sql`)

This script:
- Removes any existing `BEFORE DELETE` triggers on the `courses` table
- Creates a new trigger function that only updates `updated_at` for UPDATE operations, not DELETE
- Ensures the `courses` table has an `updated_at` column with proper indexing

### 2. Enhanced Safety (Script: `052_improve_course_delete_handling.sql`)

This script provides:
- `safe_delete_course()` function with proper error handling
- `can_delete_course()` function to check if a course can be safely deleted
- Better logging and safety checks

### 3. Type Mismatch Fix (Script: `053_fix_function_type_mismatch.sql`)

This script fixes:
- The "Returned type bigint does not match expected type integer" error
- Updates the `can_delete_course` function to return `bigint` instead of `integer`

### 4. Comprehensive Trigger Fix (Script: `054_comprehensive_trigger_fix.sql`)

This script provides:
- Complete removal of all triggers on the courses table
- Recreation of a safe UPDATE-only trigger
- Verification of trigger setup

### 5. Frontend Updates

Updated both `CourseBuilder.tsx` and `CourseManagement.tsx` to:
- Use the safer deletion approach
- Include fallback to direct deletion if the safe function fails
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Handle bigint type conversion for safety check results
- Improved try-catch error handling for robust deletion

## Implementation Steps

1. **Run the database scripts in order:**
   ```sql
   -- First, fix the trigger conflict
   \i supabase/scripts/051_fix_course_delete_trigger_conflict.sql
   
   -- Then, add the safety functions
   \i supabase/scripts/052_improve_course_delete_handling.sql
   
   -- Fix the type mismatch in can_delete_course function
   \i supabase/scripts/053_fix_function_type_mismatch.sql
   
   -- Comprehensive trigger fix (if issues persist)
   \i supabase/scripts/054_comprehensive_trigger_fix.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy the updated frontend code** that uses the new safe deletion functions with improved error handling.

## Benefits

- **Eliminates the trigger conflict error**
- **Provides better error handling** with fallback mechanisms
- **Adds safety checks** to prevent accidental deletion of courses with student data
- **Improves logging** for debugging deletion issues
- **Maintains data integrity** while allowing course deletion

## Testing

After implementing the fix:

1. Try deleting a course that has no student data
2. Try deleting a course that has student progress (should show warning but allow deletion)
3. Verify that the `updated_at` column still works correctly for UPDATE operations
4. Check that the deletion cascade works properly for related data

## Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Existing triggers on other tables are not affected
- The solution provides both immediate fix and long-term safety improvements
- The frontend changes include fallback mechanisms for robustness
