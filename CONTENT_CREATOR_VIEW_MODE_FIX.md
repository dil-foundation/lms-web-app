# Content Creator View Mode Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

Content creators were seeing a "View Mode" message saying "Course creation and editing is restricted to administrators" even though they should be able to create and edit courses.

### Root Cause:
In `CourseManagement.tsx`, the logic was:
- `isAdmin` check included only `admin` and `super_user`
- `isTeacher` check included both `teacher` AND `content_creator`
- "Create Course" button was only shown when `isAdmin` was true
- "View Mode" message was shown when `isTeacher` was true

This meant content creators were treated as teachers (view-only) instead of having course creation privileges.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### File: `src/components/admin/CourseManagement.tsx`

#### 1. **Separated Role Checks**
```typescript
// Before:
const isAdmin = profile?.role === 'admin' || profile?.role === 'super_user';
const isTeacher = profile?.role === 'teacher' || profile?.role === 'content_creator';

// After:
const isAdmin = profile?.role === 'admin' || profile?.role === 'super_user';
const isContentCreator = profile?.role === 'content_creator';
const isTeacher = profile?.role === 'teacher';

// Content creators can create/edit courses like admins
const canCreateCourses = isAdmin || isContentCreator;
```

#### 2. **Updated Button Display Logic**
```typescript
// Before:
{isAdmin && (
  <div>
    <Button>Bulk Upload</Button>
    <Button>Create Course</Button>
  </div>
)}

// After:
{canCreateCourses && (
  <div>
    {/* Only admins can do bulk upload */}
    {isAdmin && <Button>Bulk Upload</Button>}
    <Button>Create Course</Button>
  </div>
)}
```

#### 3. **Fixed View Mode Message**
```typescript
// Before:
{isTeacher && (
  <div>View Mode message...</div>
)}

// After:
{isTeacher && !isContentCreator && (
  <div>View Mode message...</div>
)}
```

#### 4. **Updated CourseCard Component**
```typescript
// Added isContentCreator to CourseCard for consistency
const isAdmin = profile?.role === 'admin' || profile?.role === 'super_user';
const isContentCreator = profile?.role === 'content_creator';
const isTeacher = profile?.role === 'teacher';
```
