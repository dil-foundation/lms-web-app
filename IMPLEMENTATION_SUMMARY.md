# Implementation Summary: Offline Quiz & Assignment Hiding

## ✅ Changes Completed

### Issue Reported
User reported that even though quiz and assignment items were hidden in the left sidebar when offline, they were still visible in the main content area.

### Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive filtering at multiple levels to ensure quiz and assignment content is completely hidden when offline.

## 📋 Changes Made

### File: `src/pages/CourseContent.tsx`

1. **Line 37**: Added `WifiOff` icon import
   - Used for the offline message display

2. **Lines 1319-1327**: Enhanced content items filtering
   - Filters `allContentItems` to exclude quiz and assignment when offline
   - Affects all navigation and progress calculations

3. **Lines 1332-1342**: Auto-redirect on offline transition
   - NEW: Automatically redirects to first available content when viewing quiz/assignment and going offline
   - Prevents users from being stuck on unavailable content

4. **Lines 1430-1453**: Main content area offline message
   - NEW: Shows friendly "Content Not Available Offline" message
   - Displays WifiOff icon with clear explanation
   - Intercepts rendering before quiz/assignment content is shown

5. **Lines 2339-2375**: Sidebar filtering (Admin/Teacher view)
   - Filters content items in sortable/reorderable view
   - Hides quiz and assignment items in the sidebar

6. **Lines 2377-2403**: Sidebar filtering (Student view)
   - Filters content items in standard view
   - Hides quiz and assignment items in the sidebar

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### Before Fix
- ❌ Sidebar: Quiz/Assignment hidden
- ❌ Main Content: Quiz/Assignment still showing (PROBLEM)
- ❌ User Experience: Confusing, non-functional content visible

### After Fix
- ✅ Sidebar: Quiz/Assignment hidden
- ✅ Main Content: Shows "Content Not Available Offline" message
- ✅ Auto-redirect: Navigates to available content automatically
- ✅ User Experience: Clear, helpful, no confusion

## 🔄 User Flow

### Scenario 1: Viewing Video, Go Offline
1. User viewing video online
2. Goes offline (DevTools or actual disconnect)
3. **Result**: Continues viewing video (videos work offline)
4. **Sidebar**: Quiz/Assignment items disappear from list

### Scenario 2: Viewing Quiz, Go Offline
1. User viewing quiz online
2. Goes offline
3. **Result**: Auto-redirects to first available video/attachment
4. **Sidebar**: Quiz/Assignment items disappear from list
5. **Console**: "📴 Redirecting from quiz to first available content"

### Scenario 3: Try to Access Quiz While Offline
1. User offline
2. Somehow tries to access quiz (direct URL, etc.)
3. **Result**: Shows "Content Not Available Offline" message
4. **Display**: Clean card with WifiOff icon and explanation
5. **Navigation**: Can still use Next/Previous to navigate to available content

## 📊 Technical Details

### Filtering Layers
1. **Data Layer**: `allContentItems` filtered via `useMemo`
2. **Navigation Layer**: Auto-redirect via `useEffect`
3. **Rendering Layer**: Sidebar content items filtered before mapping
4. **Display Layer**: Main content area checks content type before rendering

### Performance
- Uses `useMemo` for efficient filtering (only recalculates when needed)
- Uses `useEffect` for one-time redirect (only runs when offline status changes)
- No performance impact on online mode (filters only applied when offline)

### Type Safety
- All changes use existing TypeScript interfaces
- No type errors introduced
- No linter errors
