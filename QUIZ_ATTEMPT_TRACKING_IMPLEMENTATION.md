# Quiz Attempt Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation fixes the quiz retry system by properly tracking multiple attempts and providing comprehensive submission history for admin/teacher views.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Changes (`133_fix_quiz_submissions_attempt_tracking.sql`)

#### Removed:
- **Unique constraint** `quiz_submissions_user_lesson_content_unique` that prevented multiple attempts

#### Added:
- `attempt_number` - Sequential attempt number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `previous_attempt_id` - Reference to previous attempt for retry tracking
- `retry_reason` - Reason for retry (e.g., "Automatic retry - no approval required")
- `is_latest_attempt` - Boolean flag for the most recent attempt

#### New Constraints:
- `idx_quiz_submissions_latest_attempt` - Ensures only one latest attempt per user/lesson
- `idx_quiz_submissions_attempts` - Index for attempt tracking queries
- `idx_quiz_submissions_latest` - Index for admin views

#### Automatic Triggers:
- `trigger_update_quiz_attempt_tracking` - Automatically manages attempt numbers and latest attempt flags

### 2. Updated Retry Logic (`134_update_can_retry_quiz_function.sql`)

The `can_retry_quiz` function now:
- Uses `attempt_number` instead of counting submissions
- Properly tracks cooldown periods
- Returns accurate retry eligibility based on attempt count vs max retries

### 3. Admin/Teacher Views (`135_add_quiz_submissions_admin_view.sql`)

#### New Functions:
- `get_quiz_submissions_for_assessment()` - All attempts for a quiz
- `get_latest_quiz_submissions_for_assessment()` - Only latest attempts (main view)
- `get_user_quiz_attempt_history()` - Complete history for a specific user

### 4. Frontend Updates

#### CourseContent.tsx:
- Updated retry detection logic to use `attempt_number`
- Added `retry_reason` to submission data
- Updated queries to use `is_latest_attempt` flag

## Benefits

### For Students:
- ✅ Multiple attempts allowed without 409 conflicts
- ✅ Proper attempt tracking and numbering
- ✅ Retry reasons logged for transparency

### For Teachers/Admins:
- ✅ Complete attempt history for each student
- ✅ Latest attempt view for quick assessment
- ✅ Retry reason tracking for understanding student behavior
- ✅ Proper cooldown and retry limit enforcement

### For System:
- ✅ No more unique constraint violations
- ✅ Efficient queries with proper indexing
- ✅ Automatic attempt number management
- ✅ Data integrity maintained

## Migration Order

1. **Run `133_fix_quiz_submissions_attempt_tracking.sql`** - Updates schema and existing data
2. **Run `134_update_can_retry_quiz_function.sql`** - Updates retry logic
3. **Run `135_add_quiz_submissions_admin_view.sql`** - Adds admin view functions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Students can make multiple attempts without errors
- [ ] Attempt numbers are correctly assigned (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- [ ] Retry cooldowns work properly
- [ ] Max retry limits are enforced
- [ ] Admin can see all attempts in assessment view
- [ ] Latest attempt is correctly flagged
- [ ] Retry reasons are logged and visible

## Concerns Addressed

1. **409 Conflict Errors**: Fixed by removing unique constraint
2. **Attempt Tracking**: Added proper attempt numbering system
3. **Admin Visibility**: Added comprehensive view functions
4. **Data Integrity**: Maintained with proper constraints and triggers
5. **Performance**: Optimized with appropriate indexes

## Future Enhancements

- Add attempt comparison view for teachers
- Add retry analytics dashboard
- Add bulk grading for multiple attempts
- Add attempt export functionality
