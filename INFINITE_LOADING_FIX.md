# Infinite Loading Screen Fix

## Problem Analysis

The infinite loading screen after token refresh was caused by several issues:

### 1. **Session Timeout Hook Bug**
- The `useSessionTimeout.ts` hook had a malformed callback function
- This could cause session management to fail silently

### 2. **Blocking Database Checks**
- The `TOKEN_REFRESHED` event handler in `AuthContext.tsx` was performing database checks without timeouts
- These checks could hang indefinitely, blocking subsequent API requests
- Similar issue in `supabase/client.ts`

### 3. **Multi-Tab Session Conflicts**
- With 2 tabs open, cross-tab session sync could interfere with authentication flow
- Race conditions between tabs during token refresh

### 4. **Loading State Management**
- Complex debouncing and timeout mechanisms in dashboard loading
- No proper handling of failed API requests after token refresh

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Session Timeout Hook**
- Corrected the `updateLastActivity` callback function
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. **Added Timeout Protection**
- Added 5-second timeout to profile checks in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Added 3-second timeout to profile checks in `supabase/client.ts`
- Both now use `Promise.race()` to prevent blocking

### 3. **Created Session Manager**
- New utility (`src/utils/sessionManager.ts`) to manage session state
- Prevents duplicate token refreshes across tabs
- Tracks refresh state and timing

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Profile check failures no longer block the auth flow
- Better logging for debugging session issues
- Graceful fallbacks when database checks fail

## Key Changes Made

### `src/hooks/useSessionTimeout.ts`
- Fixed callback function syntax
- Improved error handling
- Better logging for debugging

### `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added timeout protection to profile checks
- Non-blocking error handling
- Better logging

### `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Added timeout protection to profile checks
- Non-blocking error handling
- Better logging

### `src/utils/sessionManager.ts` (NEW)
- Centralized session state management
- Prevents duplicate refreshes
- Tracks refresh timing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with 2 tabs open** - Verify no conflicts
2. **Test token refresh** - Should complete without hanging
3. **Test API requests after refresh** - Should work normally
4. **Test session timeout** - Should work correctly
5. **Test network issues** - Should handle gracefully

## Monitoring

Watch for these console logs:
- `ðŸ”„ [SessionManager] Token refresh started`
- `âœ… [SessionManager] Token refresh completed`
- `Profile check timeout` (if database is slow)
- `Continuing with auth flow despite profile check error`

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider implementing retry logic** for failed API requests
2. **Add more comprehensive error boundaries** for loading states
3. **Implement request queuing** for API calls during token refresh
4. **Add performance monitoring** for session management

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/useSessionTimeout.ts` - Fixed callback and improved error handling
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added timeout protection
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Added timeout protection
- `src/utils/sessionManager.ts` - New utility for session management

The infinite loading issue should now be resolved. The system will handle token refresh gracefully without blocking subsequent API requests.
