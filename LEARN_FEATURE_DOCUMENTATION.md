# Learn Feature Implementation Documentation

## Overview
The Learn Feature provides an interactive AI-powered language learning experience with real-time speech recognition, word-by-word pronunciation training, and feedback. This implementation is based on the provided reference images and WebSocket event specifications.

## WebSocket Events Implementation

}
```

#### 5. Additional Events
- `retry`: Ask user to try again
- `await_next`: Continue to next step
- `no_speech`: No speech was detected
- Binary audio responses (ArrayBuffer)

## Learning Flow States

### Conversation States
```typescript
type ConversationState = 
  | 'waiting'        // Ready for user input
  | 'listening'      // Recording user speech
  | 'processing'     // Processing audio on server
  | 'speaking'       // AI providing audio response
  | 'playing_intro'  // Playing welcome message
  | 'word_by_word'   // Playing individual words
  | 'you_said'       // Showing what user said
  | 'full_sentence'  // Ready for full sentence repetition
  | 'feedback'       // Showing feedback
  | 'no_speech';     // No speech detected
```

### Complete Learning Flow

1. **Initial State** (`waiting`)
   - User sees microphone button
   - "Press and hold to speak" instruction

2. **User Speaks** (`listening` → `processing`)
   - User holds microphone button
   - Audio recorded and sent to server
   - "Processing your speech..." message

3. **You Said Confirmation** (`you_said`)
   - Shows: "You said: [text]. Now repeat after me."
   - Displays both English and Urdu translations
   - Auto-completes after 3 seconds

4. **Word-by-Word Training** (`word_by_word`) 
   - Shows sentence breakdown
   - Highlights current word being pronounced
   - Displays: "Word X of Y: 'current_word'"
   - Uses speech synthesis for pronunciation
   - Auto-sends completion event when finished

5. **Full Sentence Practice** (`full_sentence`)
   - Shows: "Now repeat the full sentence: [sentence]"
   - Purple microphone indicator
   - User must press and hold to record full sentence

6. **Feedback** (`feedback`)
   - Shows positive feedback message
   - "Well done! You spoke very clearly..."
   - Auto-completes after 5 seconds
   - Resets state for next sentence

## UI Components Implementation

### State-Specific UI Cards

#### You Said Card
```jsx
<Card className="w-full max-w-lg shadow-lg mb-8">
  <CardContent className="p-6 text-center">
    <p className="text-lg mb-4">{currentMessage}</p>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

#### Word-by-Word Card  
```jsx
<Card className="w-full max-w-lg shadow-lg mb-8">
  <CardContent className="p-6 text-center">
    <h3 className="text-green-500 font-medium text-lg mb-4">
      Repeat after me.
    </h3>
    <div className="mb-3">
