# Admin Assessments Implementation

## Overview

This implementation allows administrators to view and manage all assessments (quizzes and assignments) across all courses in the platform, similar to the teacher view but with admin-level access to all courses.

## Features

### For Administrators
- **View All Assessments**: See all quizzes and assignments from all published courses
- **Course Filtering**: Filter assessments by specific courses
- **Search Functionality**: Search through assessment titles
- **Statistics Overview**: View comprehensive statistics including:
  - Total assessments across all courses
  - Pending grading across all courses
  - Total submissions across all courses
  - Average scores across all courses
- **Assessment Details**: View detailed information for each assessment including:
  - Assessment title and type (quiz/assignment)
  - Course name
  - Due date and overdue status
  - Submission and grading statistics
  - Average scores

### For Teachers (Existing Functionality)
- **View Own Assessments**: See only assessments from courses they teach
- **Same Interface**: Uses the same UI components as admin view
- **Course Filtering**: Filter by their own courses only

## Technical Implementation

### Database Function

#### `get_admin_assessments_data(search_query, course_filter_id)`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all assessments across all published courses for admin view
- **Parameters**:
  - `search_query`: Optional text search filter
  - `course_filter_id`: Optional course ID filter
- **Returns**: Assessment data with statistics including:
  - Assessment details (id, title, course, type, due_date)
  - Submission counts
  - Grading statistics
  - Average scores

#### Key Differences from Teacher Function
- **Scope**: Gets all published courses instead of teacher-specific courses
- **No Teacher Filter**: Doesn't filter by teacher_id
- **Admin Access**: Provides system-wide view of all assessments

### Component Updates

#### `GradeAssignments.tsx`
- **Role Detection**: Automatically detects if user is admin or teacher
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Uses appropriate database function based on user role
- **Course Loading**: Loads all courses for admin, teacher courses for teachers
- **UI Adaptation**: Updates header text and description based on user role

#### Key Changes Made
1. **Added Role Detection**: Uses `useUserProfile` hook to determine user role
2. **Conditional Data Fetching**: 
   - Admin: Uses `get_admin_assessments_data()`
   - Teacher: Uses `get_teacher_assessments_data()`
3. **Dynamic Course Loading**:
   - Admin: Loads all published courses
   - Teacher: Loads only courses they teach
4. **UI Text Updates**: Different descriptions for admin vs teacher views

## Database Schema

### Tables Used
- `courses`: Course information and status
- `course_sections`: Course structure
- `course_lessons`: Lesson information
- `course_lesson_content`: Assessment content (assignments/quizzes)
- `assignment_submissions`: Assignment submission data
- `quiz_submissions`: Quiz submission data

### Security
- **Row Level Security**: Maintains existing RLS policies
- **Function Security**: Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` for proper access control
- **Role-based Access**: Function respects user roles and permissions

## Usage

### For Administrators
1. **Navigate**: Go to Dashboard → Assessments (under MANAGEMENT section)
2. **View All**: See all assessments across all courses
3. **Filter**: Use course dropdown to filter by specific courses
4. **Search**: Use search bar to find specific assessments
5. **Review**: View statistics and detailed assessment information

### For Teachers
1. **Navigate**: Go to Dashboard → Assessments (under CLASSROOM section)
2. **View Own**: See only assessments from courses they teach
3. **Same Interface**: Use the same filtering and search functionality
4. **Grade**: Access individual assessments for grading

## Navigation Integration

The assessments page is already integrated into the navigation:

### Admin Navigation
- **Location**: MANAGEMENT section
- **Path**: `/dashboard/grade-assignments`
- **Icon**: Award icon
- **Title**: "Assessments"

### Teacher Navigation
- **Location**: CLASSROOM section
- **Path**: `/dashboard/grade-assignments`
- **Icon**: Award icon
- **Title**: "Assessments"

## Benefits

### For Administrators
- **System Overview**: Complete visibility into all assessments across the platform
- **Quality Control**: Monitor assessment quality and completion rates
- **Performance Tracking**: Track overall platform assessment performance
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify and resolve assessment-related issues

### For Teachers
- **No Changes**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Consistent Interface**: Same UI and experience as before
- **Focused View**: Still see only their own assessments

### For Platform
- **Unified Interface**: Single component serves both admin and teacher needs
- **Maintainable Code**: Shared logic reduces code duplication
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to extend with additional admin features

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Bulk Operations**: Allow admins to perform bulk actions on assessments
2. **Export Functionality**: Export assessment data for analysis
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed reporting and analytics
