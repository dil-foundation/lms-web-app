# AssignmentSubmissions.tsx Updates for Quiz Attempt Tracking

## Overview
Updated the `AssignmentSubmissions.tsx` component to work with the new quiz attempt tracking system, providing teachers with comprehensive visibility into student quiz attempts.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Interface Updates**
- Added new fields to `Submission` interface:
  - `attempt_number?: number` - Sequential attempt number
  - `is_latest_attempt?: boolean` - Flag for latest attempt
  - `retry_reason?: string` - Reason for retry
  - `total_attempts?: number` - Total attempts for this student

### 2. **Data Fetching Enhancements**
- **Quiz-specific logic**: Uses new `get_latest_quiz_submissions_for_assessment()` function for quizzes
- **Fallback support**: Falls back to original method if new functions fail
- **Assignment compatibility**: Maintains original logic for assignments
- **Attempt tracking**: Processes attempt numbers, retry reasons, and total attempts

### 3. **UI Improvements**

#### **Submission List Display**
- Shows attempt number and total attempts for each student
- Displays retry reasons when available
- Added "View All X Attempts" button for students with multiple attempts

#### **New All Attempts Dialog**
- Complete attempt history for individual students
- Shows all attempts with timestamps and scores
- Allows grading any specific attempt
- Displays retry reasons for each attempt

### 4. **New Functions**

#### **`fetchAllAttemptsForStudent()`**
- Fetches complete attempt history for a specific student
- Uses `get_user_quiz_attempt_history()` RPC function
- Processes and displays all attempts in a dedicated dialog

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**

#### **For Teachers:**
- ✅ See attempt numbers and retry reasons at a glance
- ✅ View complete attempt history for any student
- ✅ Grade any specific attempt (not just the latest)
- ✅ Understand student retry patterns and reasons

#### **For System:**
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing data
- ✅ Graceful fallback if new functions aren't available
- ✅ Maintains existing assignment grading functionality

## Technical Implementation

### **Data Flow:**
1. **Initial Load**: Fetches latest attempts using new RPC function
2. **Fallback**: Uses original method if new function fails
3. **Attempt History**: On-demand loading of complete attempt history
4. **Grading**: Works with any attempt, not just the latest

### **Error Handling:**
- Graceful fallback to original data fetching
- Console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications

### **Performance:**
- Only loads attempt history when requested
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Minimal impact on initial page load

## Benefits

### **For Teachers:**
1. **Complete Visibility**: See all student attempts, not just latest
2. **Retry Understanding**: Know why students retried quizzes
3. **Flexible Grading**: Grade any attempt, compare progress
4. **Better Assessment**: Understand student learning patterns

### **For Students:**
1. **Fair Grading**: Teachers can see improvement over attempts
2. **Transparency**: Retry reasons are visible to teachers
3. **Progress Tracking**: Teachers can see learning progression

### **For System:**
1. **Data Integrity**: Proper attempt tracking and numbering
2. **Scalability**: Efficient queries for large datasets
3. **Compatibility**: Works with both old and new data

## Migration Notes
